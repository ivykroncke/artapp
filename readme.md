## Future Development
* Displaying More Data on the App. I would like to restrict the search to just one type of data - e.g. just artworks - so that I can consistently find descriptive details in the response data from the API.
* With the narrower search, the app could analyze what styles and artists the user gravitates towards and make recommendations based on that. Artsy has some features like that built in already.
* The randomization process works, but a more truly random way of selecting works for scalability would be ideal.
